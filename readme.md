# rollinky
**rollinky** is a blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint and created with [Ignite CLI](https://ignite.com/cli).

## Get started

```
ignite chain serve
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain in development.

### Configure

Your blockchain in development can be configured with `config.yml`. To learn more, see the [Ignite CLI docs](https://docs.ignite.com).

### Web Frontend

Additionally, Ignite CLI offers both Vue and React options for frontend scaffolding:

For a Vue frontend, use: `ignite scaffold vue`
For a React frontend, use: `ignite scaffold react`
These commands can be run within your scaffolded blockchain project. 


For more information see the [monorepo for Ignite front-end development](https://github.com/ignite/web).

## Release
To release a new version of your blockchain, create and push a new tag with `v` prefix. A new draft release with the configured targets will be created.

```
git tag v0.1
git push origin v0.1
```

After a draft release is created, make your final changes from the release page and publish it.

### Install
To install the latest version of your blockchain node's binary, execute the following command on your machine:

```
curl https://get.ignite.com/username/rollinky@latest! | sudo bash
```
`username/rollinky` should match the `username` and `repo_name` of the Github repository to which the source code was pushed. Learn more about [the install process](https://github.com/allinbits/starport-installer).

## Sequencer

The sequencer is the centralized-sequencer with modifications to allow adding a Head and a Tail tx to the block. The sequencer is responsible of adding the prices to the block.

## Skip Connect

### Sidecar

The sidecar is meant to be ran on an Intel SGX machine in an TEE, it uses a gRPC unary interceptor in order to create a report and send it to the client.

### Oracle client

This is a library, which contains modified code from Skip's oracle client, in order to make it possible to receive gRPC trailers that the sidecar populates with the verifiable report.
